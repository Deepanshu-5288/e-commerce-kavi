    "question":" Why are there different prices for the same product? Is it legal?",
    "answer": "Myntra is an online marketplace platform that enables independent sellers to sell their products to buyers. The prices are solely decided by the sellers, and Myntra does not interfere in the same. There could be a possibility that the same product is sold by different sellers at different prices. Myntra rightfully fulfils all legal compliances of onboarding multiple sellers on its forum as it is a marketplace platform.\
    I saw the product at Rs. 1000 but post clicking on the product, there are multiple prices and the size which I want is being sold for Rs. 1600. Why is there a change in price in the product description page?\
    Myntra is an online marketplace, and multiple sellers could be selling a particular style at different prices as may be set by each such seller respectively. The product price on the listing page of the platform, may not always reflect the lowest price for that particular style. This is because the seller whose price is displayed on the list page is selected based on the application of a number of parameters and price is only one such parameter. However, once you land on the product display page on the platform for a specific style, you will have access to the price offered by all sellers on the platform for the relevant style."
